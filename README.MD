Additionally, DTrack provides users with valuable insights into their job search, including statistics on the number of applications submitted, response rates, and other relevant metrics. 
With DTrack, users have a powerful tool to manage their job search, saving time and reducing stress. Whether a recent graduate or a student looking for internships, DTrack is the perfect solution to streamline the job search process and help users land their dream job.

<h2>Significance</h2>

DTrack is a web application that addresses a major pain point for job seekers. With so many job openings and applications to keep track of, it can be challenging to stay organized throughout the job search process. DTrack streamlines this process and provides users with a simple and effective tool for tracking and managing their job applications.
The significance of DTrack lies in its ability to reduce stress and save time for job seekers. By providing a central platform for tracking job applications, users can avoid the confusion and frustration that comes with managing multiple spreadsheets or paper documents. DTrack also provides users with valuable insights into their job search, allowing them to make data-driven decisions about where to focus their efforts and improve their chances of success.
In addition, DTrack promotes transparency and accountability in the job search process. Users can easily see which companies they have applied to and when making it easier to follow up and stay engaged with potential employers. This helps to build stronger relationships and ultimately leads to better job opportunities and career growth.
This application is complex and involves various challenging tasks such as establishing a connection with a remote database, executing web requests, managing entries and information within the application and designing an intuitive user interface. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the project scope is not directly related to the material taught in DePauw's computer science department but rather leverages knowledge gained through online courses.
